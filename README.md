### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Caleb Cohen, I am a rising Senior at Suffolk University studying computer science!
I'm most proficient in Java, C#, and Python, with some experience in C++ , C, and Lua.

I'm currently looking for new grad positions, preferably focused on full stack or backend development.

My current projects are:
